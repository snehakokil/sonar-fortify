    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  <Paragraph>The function <code>xp_cmdshell</code> cannot be used safely.  It should not be used.</Paragraph>
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Certain functions behave in dangerous ways regardless of how they are used. The function <code>xp_cmdshell</code> launches a Windows command shell to execute the provided command string. The command executes either in the default system or a provided proxy context. However, there is no way to limit a user to prespecified set of privileged operations and any privilege grant opens up the user to execute any command string.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Identifiers without schemas should not be used in invoker's rights packages.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  In an invoker's rights, or <code>AUTHID CURRENT_USER</code> package, identifiers are first resolved against the current user's schema. This can cause unexpected behavior if the definer of the code does not explicitly say which schema an identifier belongs to.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code checks whether a user has permissions to perform an action by looking up the user in a permissions table. Most users will only have read access to <code>SYS.PERMISSIONS</code> and be unable to modify the defined permissions.<br><br><pre><br>CREATE or REPLACE FUNCTION check_permissions(<br>  p_name IN VARCHAR2, p_action IN VARCHAR2)<br>  RETURN BOOLEAN<br>  AUTHID CURRENT_USER<br>IS<br>  r_count NUMBER;<br>  perm BOOLEAN := FALSE;<br>BEGIN<br>  SELECT count(*) INTO r_count FROM PERMISSIONS<br>    WHERE name = p_name AND action = p_action;<br>  IF r_count > 0 THEN<br>    perm := TRUE;<br>  END IF;<br>  RETURN perm;<br>END check_permissions<br></pre><br><br>If the user calling the <code>check_permissions</code> function defines a <code>PERMISSIONS</code> table in their schema, the database will resolve the identifier to refer to the local table. The user would have write access to the new table and could modify it to gain permissions they wouldn't otherwise have.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The result of null comparisons using the <code>=</code> and <code>!=</code> operators is inconsistent.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  In the ANSI SQL standard, the value of <code>NULL</code> is defined as unknown. It is not equal to anything, not even another <code>NULL</code> value. Also, a null value is never not equal to another value. By default, T-SQL adopts the same behavior, but it can be turned off using the <code>SET ANSI_NULLS OFF</code> command or setting the database <code>ANSI_NULLS</code> option. In addition, certain database operations cannot or should not be performed if <code>ANSI_NULLS</code> is turned off. Therefore, it is safest to make all T-SQL code ANSI compliant.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The code in the following example will only print the message if the <code>ANSI_NULLS</code> option has been turned off:<br><pre>SET @x = NULLIF @x = NULL PRINT "ANSI NULLS OFF"</pre><br><br><b>Example 2:</b> The code in the following example will only print the message if the <code>ANSI_NULLS</code> option is turned on:<br><pre>SET @x = 1<br>IF @x != NULL PRINT "ANSI NULLS ON"<br></pre>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Revealing system data or debugging information helps an adversary learn about the system and form a plan of attack.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  An external information leak occurs when system data or debugging information leaves the program to a remote machine via a socket or network connection.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code prints CGI environment variables to a web page:<br><br><pre><br>...<br>HTP.htmlOpen;<br>  HTP.headOpen;<br>    HTP.title ('Environment Information');<br>  HTP.headClose;<br>  HTP.bodyOpen;<br>    HTP.br;<br>    HTP.print('<b>All CGI Environment Variables: </b>');<br>    OWA_UTIL.print_cgi_env;<br>    HTP.br;<br>  HTP.bodyClose;<br>HTP.htmlClose;<br>...<br></pre><br><br>Depending upon the system configuration, this information can be dumped to a console, written to a log file, or exposed to a remote user. For example, with scripting mechanisms it is trivial to redirect output information from &quot;Standard error&quot; or &quot;Standard output&quot; into a file or another program. Alternatively the system that the program runs on could have a remote logging mechanism such as a &quot;syslog&quot; server that will send the logs to a remote device. During development you will have no way of knowing where this information may end up being displayed. <br><br>In some cases the error message tells the attacker precisely what sort of an attack the system is vulnerable to. For example, a database error message can reveal that the application is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. Other error messages can reveal more oblique clues about the system. In the example above, the search path could imply information about the type of operating system, the applications installed on the system, and the amount of care that the administrators have put into configuring the program.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Commingling trusted and untrusted data in the same data structure encourages programmers to mistakenly trust unvalidated data.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  A trust boundary can be thought of as line drawn through a program. On one side of the line, data is untrusted. On the other side of the line, data is assumed to be trustworthy. The purpose of validation logic is to allow data to safely cross the trust boundary--to move from untrusted to trusted.<br><br>A trust boundary violation occurs when a program blurs the line between what is trusted and what is untrusted. The most common way to make this mistake is to allow trusted and untrusted data to commingle in the same data structure.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code accepts a <code>usrname</code> cookie and stores its value in the HTTP DB session before it verifies that the user has been authenticated.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>IF (OWA_COOKIE.get('usrname').num_vals != 0) THEN<br>usrname := OWA_COOKIE.get('usrname').vals(1);<br>END IF;<br>IF (v('ATTR_USR') IS null) THEN<br>HTMLDB_UTIL.set_session_state('ATTR_USR', usrname);<br>END IF;<br>...<br></pre><br><br>Without well-established and maintained trust boundaries, programmers will inevitably lose track of which pieces of data have been validated and which have not. This confusion will eventually allow some data to be used without first being validated.

    <name>Poor Error Handling: Empty Default Exception Handler</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Ignoring an exception can cause the program to overlook unexpected states and conditions.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Just about every serious attack on a software system begins with the violation of a programmer's assumptions. After the attack, the programmer's assumptions seem flimsy and poorly founded, but before an attack many programmers would defend their assumptions well past the end of their lunch break.<br><br>Two dubious assumptions that are easy to spot in code are "this function call can never fail" and "it doesn't matter if this call fails". When a programmer ignores an exception, they implicitly state that they are operating under one of these assumptions.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code ignores several exceptions that could be thrown while executing the insert statement.<br><br><pre><br>PROCEDURE do_it_all<br>IS<br>BEGIN<br>  BEGIN<br>    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES(...);<br>    COMMIT;<br>  EXCEPTION<br>    WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;<br>  END;<br>END do_it_all;<br></pre><br><br>An exception could be thrown because the table does not exist, a required value is not provided, or some other reason. If a failure occurs, there is no way to tell because the procedure will not report the failure or record what type of failure has occurred.

							<p>
							  Sending unvalidated data to a web browser can result in the browser executing malicious code.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:<br><br>1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source. In the case of Persistent (also known as Stored) XSS, the untrusted source is typically a database or other back-end datastore, while in the case of Reflected XSS it is typically a web request.<br><br><br>2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated.<br><br>The malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash or any other type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data like cookies or other session information to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code segment queries a database for an employee with a given ID and prints the corresponding employee's name.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>SELECT ename INTO name FROM emp WHERE id = eid;<br>HTP.htmlOpen;<br>  HTP.headOpen;<br>    HTP.title ('Employee Information');<br>  HTP.headClose;<br>  HTP.bodyOpen;<br>    HTP.br;<br>    HTP.print('<b>Employee Name: ' || name || '</b>');<br>    HTP.br;<br>  HTP.bodyClose;<br>HTP.htmlClose;<br>...<br></pre><br><br>This code functions correctly when the values of <code>name</code> are well-behaved, but it does nothing to prevent exploits if they are not. This code can appear less dangerous because the value of <code>name</code> is read from a database, whose contents are apparently managed by the application. However, if the value of <code>name</code> originates from user-supplied data, then the database can be a conduit for malicious content. Without proper input validation on all data stored in the database, an attacker can execute malicious commands in the user's web browser. This type of exploit, known as Persistent (or Stored) XSS, is particularly insidious because the indirection caused by the data store makes it more difficult to identify the threat and increases the possibility that the attack will affect multiple users. XSS got its start in this form with web sites that offered a "guestbook" to visitors. Attackers would include JavaScript in their guestbook entries, and all subsequent visitors to the guestbook page would execute the malicious code.<br><br><b>Example 2:</b> The following code segment reads an employee ID, <code>eid</code>, from an HTTP request and displays it to the user.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>-- Assume QUERY_STRING looks like EID=EmployeeID<br>eid := SUBSTR(OWA_UTIL.get_cgi_env('QUERY_STRING'), 5);<br>HTP.htmlOpen;<br>  HTP.headOpen;<br>    HTP.title ('Employee Information');<br>  HTP.headClose;<br>  HTP.bodyOpen;<br>    HTP.br;<br>    HTP.print('<b>Employee ID: ' || eid || '</b>');<br>    HTP.br;<br>  HTP.bodyClose;<br>HTP.htmlClose;<br>...<br></pre><br><br>As in Example 1, this code operates correctly if <code>eid</code> contains only standard alphanumeric text. If <code>eid</code> has a value that includes meta-characters or source code, then the code will be executed by the web browser as it displays the HTTP response.<br><br>Initially this might not appear to be much of a vulnerability. After all, why would someone enter a URL that causes malicious code to run on their own computer? The real danger is that an attacker will create the malicious URL, then use e-mail or social engineering tricks to lure victims into visiting a link to the URL. When victims click the link, they unwittingly reflect the malicious content through the vulnerable web application back to their own computers. This mechanism of exploiting vulnerable web applications is known as Reflected XSS.<br><br>As the examples demonstrate, XSS vulnerabilities are caused by code that includes unvalidated data in an HTTP response. There are three vectors by which an XSS attack can reach a victim:<br><br>- As in Example 1, the application stores dangerous data in a database or other trusted data store. The dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. Persistent XSS exploits occur when an attacker injects dangerous content into a data store that is later read and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user.<br><br>- As in Example 2, data is read directly from the HTTP request and reflected back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a user to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the user and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces victims to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the user, the content is executed and proceeds to transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the user's machine to the attacker or perform other nefarious activities.<br><br>- A source outside the application stores dangerous data in a database or other data store, and the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application as trusted data and included in dynamic content.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Relying on HTML, XML and other types of encoding to validate user input can result in the browser executing malicious code.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The use of certain encoding functions will prevent some, but not all cross-site scripting attacks. Depending on the context in which the data appear, characters beyond the basic &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, and " that are HTML-encoded and those beyond &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, ", and ' that are XML-encoded may take on meta-meaning. Relying on such encoding functions is equivalent to using a weak blacklist to prevent cross-site scripting and might allow an attacker to inject malicious code that will be executed in the browser. Because accurately identifying the context in which the data appear statically is not always possible, the HP Fortify Secure Coding Rulepacks report cross-site scripting findings even when encoding is applied and presents them as Cross-Site Scripting: Poor Validation issues.<br><br>Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:<br><br>1.

If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user.<br><br>- A source outside the application stores dangerous data in a database or other data store, and the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application as trusted data and included in dynamic content.

							  An attacker could cause the program to crash or otherwise become unavailable to legitimate users.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Attackers may be able to deny service to legitimate users by flooding the application with requests, but flooding attacks can often be defused at the network layer. More problematic are bugs that allow an attacker to overload the application using a small number of requests. Such bugs allow the attacker to specify the quantity of system resources their requests will consume or the duration for which they will use them.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code allows a user to specify the amount of time for which the system should delay further processing. By specifying a large number, an attacker can tie up the system indefinitely.<br><br><pre><br>procedure go_sleep (<br>usrSleepTime in NUMBER)<br>is<br>  dbms_lock.sleep(usrSleepTime);<br></pre>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Including unvalidated data in an HTTP response header can enable cache-poisoning, cross-site scripting, cross-user defacement, page hijacking, cookie manipulation or open redirect.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Header Manipulation vulnerabilities occur when:<br><br>1.	Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.<br><br><IfDef var="ConditionalDescriptions"><br> <br></IfDef><br><br>2.	The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without being validated.<br><br>As with many software security vulnerabilities, Header Manipulation is a means to an end, not an end in itself. At its root, the vulnerability is straightforward: an attacker passes malicious data to a vulnerable application, and the application includes the data in an HTTP response header.<br><br>One of the most common Header Manipulation attacks is HTTP Response Splitting. To mount a successful HTTP Response Splitting exploit, the application must allow input that contains CR (carriage return, also given by %0d or \r) and LF (line feed, also given by %0a or \n)characters into the header. These characters not only give attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response the application intends to send, but also allows them to create additional responses entirely under their control.<br><br>Many of today's modern application servers will prevent the injection of malicious characters into HTTP headers. If your application server prevents setting headers with new line characters, then your application is not vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting. However, solely filtering for new line characters can leave an application vulnerable to Cookie Manipulation or Open Redirects, so care must still be taken when setting HTTP headers with user input.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code segment reads the name of the author of a weblog entry, <code>author</code>, from an HTTP request and sets it in a cookie header of an HTTP response.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>-- Assume QUERY_STRING looks like AUTHOR_PARAM=Name<br>author := SUBSTR(OWA_UTIL.get_cgi_env('QUERY_STRING'), 14);<br>OWA_UTIL.mime_header('text/html', false);<br>OWA_COOKE.send('author', author);<br>OWA_UTIL.http_header_close;<br>...<br></pre><br><br>Assuming a string consisting of standard alpha-numeric characters, such as "Jane Smith", is submitted in the request the HTTP response including this cookie might take the following form:<br><br><pre><br>HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>...<br>Set-Cookie: author=Jane Smith<br>...<br></pre><br><br>However, because the value of the cookie is formed of unvalidated user input the response will only maintain this form if the value submitted for <code>AUTHOR_PARAM</code> does not contain any CR and LF characters. If an attacker submits a malicious string, such as "Wiley Hacker\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n...", then the HTTP response would be split into two responses of the following form:<br><br><pre><br>HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>...<br>Set-Cookie: author=Wiley Hacker<br><br>HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>...<br></pre><br><br>Clearly, the second response is completely controlled by the attacker and can be constructed with any header and body content desired. The ability of attacker to construct arbitrary HTTP responses permits a variety of resulting attacks, including: cross-user defacement, web and browser cache poisoning, cross-site scripting and page hijacking.<br><br><b>Cross-User Defacement:</b> An attacker can make a single request to a vulnerable server that will cause the server to create two responses, the second of which may be misinterpreted as a response to a different request, possibly one made by another user sharing the same TCP connection with the server. This can be accomplished by convincing the user to submit the malicious request themselves, or remotely in situations where the attacker and the user share a common TCP connection to the server, such as a shared proxy server. In the best case, an attacker can leverage this ability to convince users that the application has been hacked, causing users to lose confidence in the security of the application. In the worst case, an attacker may provide specially crafted content designed to mimic the behavior of the application but redirect private information, such as account numbers and passwords, back to the attacker.<br><br><b>Cache Poisoning:</b> The impact of a maliciously constructed response can be magnified if it is cached either by a web cache used by multiple users or even the browser cache of a single user. If a response is cached in a shared web cache, such as those commonly found in proxy servers, then all users of that cache will continue receive the malicious content until the cache entry is purged. Similarly, if the response is cached in the browser of an individual user, then that user will continue to receive the malicious content until the cache entry is purged, although only the user of the local browser instance will be affected.<br><br><b>Cross-Site Scripting:</b> Once attackers have control of the responses sent by an application, they have a choice of a variety of malicious content to provide users. Cross-site scripting is common form of attack where malicious JavaScript or other code included in a response is executed in the user's browser. The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data like cookies or other session information to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site. The most common and dangerous attack vector against users of a vulnerable application uses JavaScript to transmit session and authentication information back to the attacker who can then take complete control of the victim's account.<br><br><b>Page Hijacking:</b> In addition to using a vulnerable application to send malicious content to a user, the same root vulnerability can also be leveraged to redirect sensitive content generated by the server and intended for the user to the attacker instead. By submitting a request that results in two responses, the intended response from the server and the response generated by the attacker, an attacker can cause an intermediate node, such as a shared proxy server, to misdirect a response generated by the server for the user to the attacker. Because the request made by the attacker generates two responses, the first is interpreted as a response to the attacker's request, while the second remains in limbo. When the user makes a legitimate request through the same TCP connection, the attacker's request is already waiting and is interpreted as a response to the victim's request. The attacker then sends a second request to the server, to which the proxy server responds with the server generated request intended for the victim, thereby compromising any sensitive information in the headers or body of the response intended for the victim.<br><br><b>Cookie Manipulation:</b> When combined with attacks like Cross-Site Request Forgery, attackers can change, add to, or even overwrite a legitimate user's cookies.<br><br><b>Open Redirect:</b> Allowing unvalidated input to control the URL used in a redirect can aid phishing attacks.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Allowing unvalidated input to control the URL used in a redirect can aid phishing attacks.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Redirects allow web applications to direct users to different pages within the same application or to external sites. Applications utilize redirects to aid in site navigation and, in some cases, to track how users exit the site. Open redirect vulnerabilities occur when a web application redirects clients to any arbitrary URL that can be controlled by an attacker.<br><br>  Attackers can utilize open redirects to trick users into visiting a URL to a trusted site and redirecting them to a malicious site. By encoding the URL, an attacker can make it more difficult for end-users to notice the malicious destination of the redirect, even when it is passed as a URL parameter to the trusted site. Open redirects are often abused as part of phishing scams to harvest sensitive end-user data.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> The following procedure instructs the user's browser to open a URL parsed from the <code>dest</code> request parameter when a user clicks the link.<br><br>  <pre><br>      ...<br>      -- Assume QUERY_STRING looks like dest=http://www.wilyhacker.com<br>      dest := SUBSTR(OWA_UTIL.get_cgi_env('QUERY_STRING'), 6);<br>      OWA_UTIL.redirect_url('dest');<br>      ...<br>  </pre><br><br>  If a victim received an email instructing the user to follow a link to &quot;http://trusted.example.com/pls/hr/showemps?dest=www.wilyhacker.com&quot;, the user would likely click on the link believing they would be transferred to the trusted site. However, when the user clicks the link, the code above will redirect the browser to &quot;http://www.wilyhacker.com&quot;.<br><br>  Many users have been educated to always inspect URLs they receive in emails to make sure the link specifies a trusted site they know. However, if the attacker Hex encoded the destination url as follows:<br>   &quot;http://trusted.example.com/pls/hr/showemps?dest=%77%69%6C%79%68%61%63%6B%65%72%2E%63%6F%6D&quot;<br><br>  then even a savvy end-user may be fooled into following the link.

							  Allowing user input to control resource identifiers could enable an attacker to access or modify otherwise protected system resources.

							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  A resource injection issue occurs when the following two conditions are met:<br><br>3.	An attacker can specify the identifier used to access a system resource.<br><br>For example, an attacker may be able to specify a port number to be used to connect to a network resource.<br><br>4.	By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.<br><br>For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to transmit sensitive information to a third-party server.<br><br>Note: Resource injection that involves resources stored on the filesystem goes by the name path manipulation and is reported in separate category. See the path manipulation description for further details of this vulnerability.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code uses a CGI environment variable as a URL of a document to be downloaded.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>filename := SUBSTR(OWA_UTIL.get_cgi_env('PATH_INFO'), 2);<br>WPG_DOCLOAD.download_file(filename);<br>...<br></pre><br><br>The kind of resource affected by user input indicates the kind of content that may be dangerous.  For example, data containing special characters like period, slash, and backslash are risky when used in functions that interact with the file system.

The query restricts the items displayed to those where owner is equal to the user name of the currently authenticated user.<br><br><pre><br>procedure get_item (<br>     itm_cv IN OUT ItmCurTyp,<br>     usr in varchar2,<br>     itm in varchar2)<br>is<br>     open itm_cv for ' SELECT * FROM items WHERE ' ||<br>                   'owner = '''|| usr || '''' ||<br>                   ' AND itemname = ''' || itm || '''';<br>     end get_item;<br></pre><br><br>The query this code intends to execute is the following:<br><br><pre><br>	SELECT * FROM items<br>	WHERE owner = &lt;userName&gt;<br>	AND itemname = &lt;itemName&gt;;<br></pre><br><br>However, because the query is constructed dynamically by concatenating a constant base query string and a user input string, the query only behaves correctly if <code>itemName</code> does not contain a single-quote character. If an attacker with the user name <code>wiley</code> enters the string "<code>name' OR 'a'='a</code>" for <code>itm</code>, then the query becomes the following:<br><br><pre><br>	SELECT * FROM items<br>	WHERE owner = 'wiley'<br>	AND itemname = 'name' OR 'a'='a';<br></pre><br><br>The addition of the <code>OR 'a'='a'</code> condition causes the where clause to always evaluate to true, so query becomes logically equivalent to the much simpler query:<br><br><pre><br>	SELECT * FROM items;<br></pre><br><br>This simplification of the query allows the attacker to bypass the requirement that the query only return items owned by the authenticated user; the query now returns all entries stored in the <code>items</code> table, regardless of their specified owner.<br><br><b>Example 2:</b> In this example, we will consider the effects of a different malicious value passed to the query constructed and executed in Example 1. If an attacker with the user name <code>wiley</code> enters the string "<code>name'; DELETE FROM items; --</code>" for <code>itemName</code>, then the query becomes the following two queries:<br><br><pre><br>	SELECT * FROM items<br>	WHERE owner = 'wiley'<br>	AND itemname = 'name';<br><br>	DELETE FROM items;<br><br>	--'<br></pre><br><br>Many database servers, including Microsoft(R) SQL Server 2000, allow multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons to be executed at once. While this attack string would result in an error on Oracle and other database servers that do not allow the batch-execution of statements separated by semicolons, on supported databases this type of attack will allow the execution of arbitrary commands against the database.<br><br>Notice the trailing pair of hyphens (--); these indicate to most database servers that the remainder of the statement is to be treated as a comment and not executed [4]. In this case the comments are used to remove the trailing single-quote leftover from the modified query. On a database where comments are not allowed to be used in this way, the general attack could still be made effective using a trick similar to what we saw Example 1. If an attacker enters the string "<code>name'); DELETE FROM items; SELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a</code>" to create the following three valid statements:<br><br><pre><br>	SELECT * FROM items<br>	WHERE owner = 'wiley'<br>	AND itemname = 'name';<br><br>	DELETE FROM items;<br><br>	SELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a';<br></pre><br><br>One traditional approach to preventing SQL injection attacks is to handle them as an input validation problem and either accept only a whitelist of safe values or identify and escape a blacklist of potentially malicious values. Whitelisting can be a very effective means of enforcing strict input validation rules, but parameterized SQL statements require less maintenance and can offer more guarantees with respect to security. As is almost always the case, blacklisting is riddled with loopholes that make it ineffective at preventing SQL injection attacks. For example, attackers can:<br><br>	- Target fields that are not quoted<br>	- Find ways to bypass the need for certain escaped meta-characters<br>	- Use stored procedures to hide the injected meta-characters<br><br>Manually escaping characters in input to SQL queries can help, but it will not make your application secure from SQL injection attacks.<br><br>Another solution commonly proposed for dealing with SQL injection attacks is to use stored procedures. As this series of examples has shown, stored procedures can be just as vulnerable as other kinds of code. Stored procedures can help prevent certain types of exploits, but they will not make your application inherently secure from SQL injection attacks.

							<p>
							  Without proper access control, executing a SQL statement that contains a user-controlled primary key can allow an attacker to view unauthorized records.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Database access control errors occur when:<br><br>1. Data enters a program from an untrusted source.<br><br>2. The data is used to specify the value of a primary key in a SQL query.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code uses a parameterized statement, which escapes metacharacters and prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities, to construct and execute a SQL query that searches for an invoice matching the specified identifier [1].

Although the interface generates a list of invoice identifiers that belong to the current user, an attacker can bypass this interface to request any desired invoice. Because the code in this example does not check to ensure that the user has permission to access the requested invoice, it will display any invoice, even if it does not belong to the current user.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Standard pseudo-random number generators cannot withstand cryptographic attacks.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Insecure randomness errors occur when a function that can produce predictable values is used as a source of randomness in a security-sensitive context.<br><br>Computers are deterministic machines, and as such are unable to produce true randomness. Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) approximate randomness algorithmically, starting with a seed from which subsequent values are calculated.<br><br>There are two types of PRNGs: statistical and cryptographic. Statistical PRNGs provide useful statistical properties, but their output is highly predictable and forms an easy to reproduce numeric stream that is unsuitable for use in cases where security depends on generated values being unpredictable. Cryptographic PRNGs address this problem by generating output that is more difficult to predict. For a value to be cryptographically secure, it must be impossible or highly improbable for an attacker to distinguish between it and a truly random value. In general, if a PRNG algorithm is not advertised as being cryptographically secure, it is probably a statistical PRNG and should not be used in security-sensitive contexts, where its use can lead to serious vulnerabilities such as easy-to-guess temporary passwords, predictable cryptographic keys, session hijacking, and DNS spoofing.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code uses a statistical PRNG to create a URL for a receipt that remains active for some period of time after a purchase.<br><br><pre><br>CREATE or REPLACE FUNCTION CREATE_RECEIPT_URL<br>  RETURN VARCHAR2<br>AS<br>  rnum VARCHAR2(48);<br>  time TIMESTAMP;<br>  url VARCHAR2(MAX_URL)<br>BEGIN<br>  time := SYSTIMESTAMP;<br>  DBMS_RANDOM.SEED(time);<br>  rnum := DBMS_RANDOM.STRING('x', 48);<br>  url := 'http://test.com/' || rnum || '.html';<br>  RETURN url;<br>END<br></pre><br><br>This code uses the <code>DBMS_RANDOM.SEED()</code> function to generate "unique" identifiers for the receipt pages it generates. Because <code> DBMS_RANDOM.SEED()</code> is a statistical PRNG, it is easy for an attacker to guess the strings it generates. Although the underlying design of the receipt system is also faulty, it would be more secure if it used a random number generator that did not produce predictable receipt identifiers.

							<p>
							  Hardcoding or storing a password in plaintext could result in a system compromise.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Password management issues occur when a password is hardcoded or stored in plaintext in an application's configuration files or other data store. It is never a good idea to hardcode a password. Not only does hardcoding a password allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. Once the code is in production, the password cannot be changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code authenticates the user by reading the password that the user used to log into the database server and comparing it to an expected value.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>ip_address := OWA_SEC.get_client_ip;<br>IF ((OWA_SEC.get_user_id = 'scott') AND<br>    (OWA_SEC.get_password = 'tiger') AND<br>    (ip_address(1) = 144) and (ip_address(2) = 25)) THEN<br>        RETURN TRUE;<br>ELSE<br>        RETURN FALSE;<br>END IF;<br>...<br></pre><br><br>This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the database user "scott" with a password of "tiger" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Empty passwords can compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  It is never a good idea to assign an empty string to a password variable. If the empty password is used to successfully authenticate against another system, then the corresponding account's security is likely compromised because it accepts an empty password. If the empty password is merely a placeholder until a legitimate value can be assigned to the variable, then it can confuse anyone unfamiliar with the code and potentially cause problems on unexpected control flow paths.<br><br><br><br><b>Example:</b> The code below initializes an empty password variable.<br><pre><br>DECLARE<br>    pwd VARCHAR(20);<br>BEGIN<br>    pwd := "";<br>END;<br></pre>

							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  It is never a good idea to hardcode a password. Not only does hardcoding a password allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. Once the code is in production, the password cannot be changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability.<br><br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code hardcodes a password:<br><br><pre><br>DECLARE<br>    pwd VARCHAR(20);<br>BEGIN<br>    pwd := "tiger";<br>END;<br></pre><br><br>This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from a password of "tiger" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system. Even worse, if attackers have access to the binary for the application they can use one of many publicly available decompilers to access the disassembled code, which will contain the values of the passwords used.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Storing passwords or password details in plaintext anywhere in the system or system code can compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  It is never a good idea to hardcode a password. Storing password details within comments is equivalent to hardcoding passwords.  Not only does it allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. Once the code is in production, the password is now leaked to the outside world and cannot be protected or changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability.<br><br><br><b>Example:</b> The following comment specifies the default password to connect to a database:<br><br><pre><br>...<br>-- Default username for database connection is "scott"<br>-- Default password for database connection is "tiger"<br>...<br></pre><br><br>This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the database user "scott" with a password of "tiger" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Mishandling private information, such as customer passwords or social security numbers, can compromise user privacy and is often illegal.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Privacy violations occur when:<br><br>1. Private user information enters the program.<br><br>2. The data is written to an external location, such as the console, file system or network.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code sends account credentials to a web user. Specifically, the <code>OWA_SEC.get_password()</code> function returns the user-supplied plaintext password associated with the account, which is then printed to the HTTP response.<br><pre><br>...<br>HTP.htmlOpen;<br>  HTP.headOpen;<br>    HTP.title (.Account Information.);<br>  HTP.headClose;<br>  HTP.bodyOpen;<br>    HTP.br;<br>    HTP.print('<b>User ID: ' ||<br>               OWA_SEC.get_user_id || '</b>');<br>    HTP.print('<b>User Password: ' ||<br>               OWA_SEC.get_password || '</b>');<br>    HTP.br;<br>  HTP.bodyClose;<br>HTP.htmlClose;<br>...<br></pre><br><br>Other examples may contain logging statements that store plaintext passwords to the filesystem. Although many developers trust the filesystem as a safe storage location for data, it should not be trusted implicitly, particularly when privacy is a concern.<br><br>Private data can enter a program in a variety of ways:<br><br>- Directly from the user in the form of a password or personal information<br><br>- Accessed from a database or other data store by the application<br><br>- Indirectly from a partner or other third party<br><br>Sometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private.<br><br>Security and privacy concerns often seem to compete with each other. From a security perspective, you should record all important operations so that any anomalous activity can later be identified. However, when private data is involved, this practice can create risk.<br><br>Although there are many ways in which private data can be handled unsafely, a common risk stems from misplaced trust. Programmers often trust the operating environment in which a program runs, and therefore believe that it is acceptable to store private information on the file system, in the registry, or in other locally-controlled resources. However, even if access to certain resources is restricted, this does not guarantee that the individuals who do have access can be trusted. For example, in 2004, an unscrupulous employee at AOL sold approximately 92 million private customer e-mail addresses to a spammer marketing an offshore gambling web site [1].<br><br>In response to such high-profile exploits, the collection and management of private data is becoming increasingly regulated. Depending on its location, the type of business it conducts, and the nature of any private data it handles, an organization may be required to comply with one or more of the following federal and state regulations:<br><br>- Safe Harbor Privacy Framework [3]<br><br>- Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLBA) [4]<br><br>- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [5]<br><br>- California SB-1386 [6]<br><br>Despite these regulations, privacy violations continue to occur with alarming frequency.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Granting all privileges on an object may give users more privileges than expected.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Using the <code>ALL PRIVILEGES</code> or <code>ALL</code> option will grant the user all of the permissions that can be applied to an object. The programmer may not be aware of all of the privileges being granted.<br><br><b>Example:</b> An administrator may want to give a user the ability to update the data in the procedure.<br><br><pre><br>GRANT ALL ON employees TO john_doe;<br></pre><br><br>In addition to the ability to select, update, add, and remove rows, <code>john_doe</code> now has permission to change the definition of the table.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Weak cryptographic hashes cannot guarantee data integrity and should not be used in security-critical contexts.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  MD5 and SHA-1 are popular cryptographic hash algorithms often used to verify the integrity of messages and other data. Recent advances in cryptanalysis have discovered weaknesses in both algorithms. Consequently, MD5 and SHA-1 should no longer be relied upon to verify the authenticity of data in security-critical contexts.<br><br>Techniques for breaking MD5 hashes are advanced and widely available enough that the algorithm must not be relied upon for security. In the case of SHA-1, current techniques still require a significant amount of computational power and are more difficult to implement. However, attackers have found the Achilles' heel for the algorithm, and techniques for breaking it will likely lead to the discovery of even faster attacks.
